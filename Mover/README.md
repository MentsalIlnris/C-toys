# Mover

not that mover in homeworld2, but a virtual mover that move randomly in  planar space.

you can simply change the code in `PlanarMover`to adapt the program to any dimension of space.

>The Hiigarans managed to capture a damaged mover in the Karos Graveyard and developed weapon modifications to defeat them more easily. They also created a Mover Construction Facility in the Mothership to produce their own movers. They proved ineffective in combat against the Vaygr strike craft and corvettes as the Vaygr had already developed the same anti-mover weapon modifications. They can, however, inflict heavy damage to Capital ships which are usually unable to properly target them.
